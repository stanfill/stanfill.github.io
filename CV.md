### R packages

`apsimr` - edit, run and evaluate APSIM simulations from R easily.  Version 1.1 is available on [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/apsimr/index.html).  This version of the package includes several bug fixes, a connection to the package [sensitivity](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sensitivity/index.html) and functions to execute novel sensitivity analysis techniques.

`rotations` - a package to generate, estimate, visualize and infer about random rotations in SO(3).  Version 1.3 available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rotations/index.html).  Version 1.4 includes measures of discord and new distribution on SO(3); it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stanfill/rotationsC/tree/master/rotations).
